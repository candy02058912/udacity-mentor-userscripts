# Udacity Mentor Userscripts

Udacity Tampermonkey Userscripts to make mentors lives easier.

# Getting Started

## 1. Install Tampermonkey

Since I only use Chrome, so the instructions are mainly for Chrome. Feel feel to contribute details for other browsers.

- Chrome - install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome).

## 2. Install Userscript

Currently there's only a script for a notes section to the student hub.

### [Student Hub Notes](https://github.com/candy02058912/udacity-mentor-userscripts/raw/master/src/student-hub-notes)

- [Click to install](https://github.com/candy02058912/udacity-mentor-userscripts/raw/master/dist/student-hub-notes.user.js)

Idea originated from Sertac Ozker.

All notes are stored in **local storage**, so if you change your device and install this script, data will not persist.

If you want to **delete** the notes from local storage, all keys are prefixed with `candy`.
